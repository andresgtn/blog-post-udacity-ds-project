Two datasets
- Wine quality based on physicochemical tests
- Wine quality based on origin, variety, winery

Questions
Dataset 1: 
link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

*Q. What physicochemical properties about wine contribute to quality?
	- SQ. If so, what physicochemical properties does a winery need to pay particular attention to ensure high-quality wine? (which to augment and which to avoid at all costs)

Dataset 2
link: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews?select=winemag-data_first150k.csv
*Q. Is there reviewer bias? (should you pick a particular reviewer to review your new wine?)
*Q. Is there a wine variety that is generally more expensive than the rest?
*Q. What are the best wineries and regions?
*Q. Can we find good value for money, i.e. cheap wine with a high score? And is there a region/winery that excels at this? (they might be leaving money on the table)
*Q. Are there common descriptors for good vs less good wines? (For example, having oak vs cedar play a role in score?)(from the sommelier's wine wine description)
